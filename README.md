# BlogFish

[BlogFish](https://blogfish.fr) is a little blog I made to share my knowledge about IT, CyberSecurity and other things. I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which is an awesome tool to make static websites and blogs really quickly and cleanly.

If you want to, you can use it as a theme for your own blog while you don't keep the same name and the same illustration. ^^'
